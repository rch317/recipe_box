### Assembly Instructions
1. Set your oven to 450 and warm your chamber while assembling the project.
2. Using a pie tin or large cookie sheet, coat lightly with butter or oil. I prefer butter here, but you do you. I would recommend covering the cookie sheet with some aluminum foil, as this can get messy.
3. Roll out the pie crust onto your preferred build plate,  I don't recommend PEI though.
4. Lay down a good bed of your choice of preserves in the center of the pie crust.
5. Lay the brie ontop of the bed of preserves, should still be centered.
6. Slather the top of the brie with more preserves!
7. Sprinkle in some crushed/chopped nuts of your choice, or not... Totally optional!
    - If you were planning to add spices;  now is a good time to do that.
8. Fold the pie crust up to cover the brie.  I like do this by making 4 corners and bring them into the center. You can pin these with toothpicks but usually just pressing the ends together is enough to hold.
9. Once your chamber has reached the appropriate temp,  toss in the cookie sheet and give it about 15-20 minutes.
10. Remove and allow it to cool for at least 10 minutes before attempting to remove from the build sheet.
11. Cut into wedges
12. FEAST

### Optional / Notes
An egg wash or even a butter baste can really set this off.  Sprinkle some nuts and spices on the top. A little kosher salt goes really well with this as well and actually bring out the sweetness quite a bit.Adding a dollop of preserves to the top of the build, just before cutting it up, can be a nice touch too.
